> KickThemOut v2.0 is finally here, along with major fixes and modifications! 

## Major new changes

### Python 3 compatibility (yay)

Following several requests and recommendations from the community, KickThemOut has officially shifted to compatibility with Python 3! 🎊

Here's what the new *Debian* installation looks like:

```bash
~ ❯❯❯ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nmap
~ ❯❯❯ git clone https://github.com/k4m4/kickthemout.git
~ ❯❯❯ cd kickthemout/
~/kickthemout ❯❯❯ sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt
~/kickthemout ❯❯❯ sudo python3 kickthemout.py
```

For installation instructions on *Arch* and *macOS* devices, refer to the repository's [readme page](https://github.com/k4m4/kickthemout).

### Non-interactive attack (using `optparser`)

KickThemOut can now be run using terminal arguments, meaning that users are not required to go through the interactive selection process anymore.

Here are v2.0's usage arguments:

```bash
Usage: sudo python3 kickthemout.py [options]

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PACKETS, --packets=PACKETS
                        number of packets broadcasted per minute (default: 6)
  -s, --scan            perform a quick network scan and exit
  -t TARGETS, --target=TARGETS
                        specify target IP address(es) and perform attack

Examples:
  sudo python3 kickthemout.py --target 192.168.1.10 
  sudo python3 kickthemout.py -t 192.168.1.5,192.168.1.10 -p 30
  sudo python3 kickthemout.py -s
  sudo python3 kickthemout.py (interactive mode)
```

To view all available options from your terminal run:

```bash
~/kickthemout ❯❯❯ sudo python3 kickthemout.py -h
```

In addition, users can now avoid the full network scan that occurs when running KickThemOut interactively (i.e. `~ ❯❯❯ sudo python3 kickthemout.py`) and can immediately initiate an attack using short and simple commands such as:

```bash
~/kickthemout ❯❯❯ sudo python3 kickthemout.py -t {TARGET_IP} -p {#_OF_PACKETS/MIN}
```

> An example of a non-interactive attack:

![KTO_Scan](/static/images/kickthemout-v2-0/kto_scan_blurred.png)

The image above displays KickThemOut's network scanning argument for fast  active host discovery. As you can see, each device's host name is also shown (shoutout to [R3DDY](https://github.com/R3DDY97) for his commits).

![KTO_Non-Interactive_Attack](/static/images/kickthemout-v2-0/kto_attack_blurred.png)

In this example, KickThemOut is broadcasting 60 packets per minute (i.e. 1 packet/sec), kicking out the host with IP address `192.168.1.16`, using the non-interactive attack method.

Finally, I would like to thank you all for your inspiring messages and great support.
