## Brief Description

```
This level is about unscrambling words.

Find the original (unscrambled) words, which were randomly taken from a wordlist.<--
Send a comma separated list of the original words, in the same order as in the list below.

You have 30 seconds time to send the solution.
```

```
List of scrambled words:     anbdnor
                             foloabtl
                             lddaie
                             aenvass
                             cgaillo
                             oternh
                             lonecle

As you can understand, we are primarily given a (pretty long) [wordlist](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/prog/1/wordlist.zip) or dictionary if you like, as well as a list of scrambled words.

Our objective is obvious. We must find which original, 'unscrambled' word from the given wordlist matches which 'scrambled' word from the list, in the given time (of 30 seconds).

We are lastly asked to submit our output in comma-separated format: `(Example: word1,word2,word3, ... word9,word10)`. 

I bet you've already thought of a way to approach this easy task. No? Don't worry, I'll give you a hand.

## The Code

You can use most languages to solve this challenge (e.g. ruby, java & python). Personally, I chose to use my, by far, favorite language - Python.

What I want Python to do for me is, firstly, read through the two lists and sort all strings alphabetically. Subsequently, I want it to iterate through each one of the scrambled words, and look for a match in the wordlist. Once a match is established, it will append the unscrambled form of the word to a list, and once all strings are matched, it displays the final list in comma-separated format (as requested by HTS).

Here is my final piece of code:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python
# scrambled.py

## How To Use

1. **Download** the [ZIP file](https://gist.github.com/nikolaskama/0b9c554c3a04205ea9f84abbafe1cb48/archive/fead0747013a9d0421acb1c0625f690ec36ec672.zip) from Github Gist.
2. **Paste** your **list of scrambled words** into the `scrambled.txt` file. (Overwrite the original file, and replace its contents with your scrambled words.)
3. **Run** the python file using either your compiler (e.g. IDLE or Atom), or by simply executing it through terminal: `$ python scrambled.py`. (If you're using terminal, make sure you are in the right directory.)
4. **Submit** the **comma-separated** output to the HackThisSite website by copying and pasting it to the `Answer:` form of Level 1.

Woo-hoo! Piece of cake, wasn't it?

Stay put. More coming!
